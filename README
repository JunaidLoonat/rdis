// BUILDING

; If you build rdis for a distro not listed below, let me know how you did it
; by emailing me at endeavor at rainbowsandpwnies.com

* Arch Linux
    Use the rdis-git PKGBUILD from the aur.

* openSUSE 12.2 x86_64 (from kohelet)
    - zypper install gtk3-devel libjansson-devel libopenssl-devel
    - Grab LuaJIT-2.0.0 and install it
    - Grab udis86-1.7 and install it
    - Add "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" to .bashrc
    - Download rdis from http://github.com/endeav0r
    - Unzip and install rdis.

* Ubuntu 12.10
    The following packages are required to build rdis in Ubuntu 12.10
    libluajit-5.1-dev libssl-dev libjansson-dev libgtk-3-dev libcairo2-dev

    You will also need to grab udis86 and install it

* Fedora (from Killboy Powerhed)
    ## rdis dependencies for Fedora
    $ yum -y install cairo-devel gtk3-devel jansson-devel openssl-devel udis86-devel

    ## luajit is not in Fedora as yet, build from source or get candidate src rpm
    ## ref: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=718681
    $ cd ~/Downloads && wget http://dl.dropbox.com/u/11270386/luajit-2.0.0-0.4.beta9.fc17.src.rpm

    ## assuming you've set up an rpm building environment
    $ rpmbuild --rebuild ~/Downloads/luajit-2.0.0-0.4.beta9.fc17.src.rpm
    $ sudo rpm -Uvh ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/<arch>/luajit-2*
    $ sudo rpm -Uvh ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/<arch>/luajit-devel-2*

* Other
    Dependencies: gtk3, luajit, cairo, jansson

    There's not autoconf for rdis, so you may need to make some changes to get it
    to build on your platform.
